			</hgroup><p id="p0">A &#226;&#128;&#156;minimum statutory wage&#226;&#128;&#157; is that which the statute prescribes
                                    and it may be higher than the bare subsistence wage providing for
                                    some measure of education, medical requirements and amenities.
                                    The SC has held that statutory wage under the Act aims to ensure
                                    not only subsistence for the employee and his family but also
                                    preserve his efficiency as a worker.10</p>

                                   (i.e. exploitation of labour) as well as exploitation of unorganized
                                   labour. As recently as 1941 and 1996 the Bombay and Karnataka
                                   HC&#226;&#128;&#153;s have held that non payment of minimum wages is violative
                                   of the fundamental Right in Article 23 of the Constitution (all
                                   Fundamental Rights are enforceable in a court of law).<audio controls="controls" src="http://devel.virtual-labs.ac.in/alipi/wsgi/upload90.ogg" foruri="http://www.a11y.in/a11y_dw/min.html:p1" id="aud_p11622866" rec="Audio"></audio></p>

                                     payment of a minimum wage mandatory several other
                                     provisions beneficial to the workers apply:

                                 mentioned in a list (&#226;&#128;&#156;Schedule&#226;&#128;&#157;) attached to the Act (referred
                                 to as &#226;&#128;&#156;Scheduled Employments&#226;&#128;&#157;). It is in the government&#226;&#128;&#153;s
                                 discretion whether or not to include a particular employment
                                 in the Schedule. The work of garbage collection done by the
                                 BMP Contract labour is not a notified employment.</li>
			     
			    <li>If the Scheduled Employment has 1000 or more workers then
                                the Government is bound under law to fix a Minimum wage
                                via notification </li>
 			    <li>The Government may if it thinks fit fix a minimum wage for
                                a Scheduled Employment where there are less than 1000
                                workers employed.</li>

	         <p id="box_txt">The shaded portion indicates those employments, which are both scheduled ones and also employ more than 1000 workers. Here the government is obliged to notify a minimum wage and an application can be made to the High Court. For scheduled employments in Karnataka see Annexure 2. In practice, a minimum wage may not be notified for every scheduled employment. For example, in 1996 in Karnataka there were 61 employments in the schedule only 37 for which a minimum wage had been fixed.</p>
